      "symptoms": [
        "Interveinal reddening of leaves in red grape varieties (in green varieties, leaves turn yellow).",
        "Leaves roll downwards and inwards.",
        "Affected leaves often thicken and become leathery.",
        "Delayed bud break and reduced shoot growth.",
        "Reduced fruit set, smaller berries, and lower sugar content.",
        "Can lead to significant yield loss and poor wine quality."
      ],
      "favorable_conditions": "Spread is primarily by vegetative propagation of infected planting material and by vectors, mainly vine mealybugs (Planococcus ficus and Pseudococcus longispinus).",
      "preventive_measures": [
        "Use only certified virus-free planting material.",
        "Control vine mealybug populations diligently.",
        "Rogue out and destroy infected vines from the vineyard.",
        "Ensure isolation from other vineyards that may be infected.",
        "Regular testing of vines for virus presence.",
        "Quarantine imported plant material."

        "organic": [
          "Intensive management of mealybug vectors using natural enemies (e.g., ladybugs, parasitic wasps) and appropriate biological control agents.",
          "Good sanitation practices to remove infected plant parts."
        ],
        "chemical": [
          "Chemical control of mealybugs using systemic insecticides like imidacloprid or acetamiprid, applied as soil drench or foliar spray. However, this is a management strategy for the vector, not a cure for the virus. Cultural practices and vector control are paramount.",
          "There is no chemical cure for virus diseases. Management focuses on prevention and vector control."
