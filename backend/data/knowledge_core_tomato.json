      "name": "Tomato Spotted Wilt Virus (TSWV)",
      "causal_agent": "Tospovirus (genus Tospovirus, family Bunyaviridae)",
      "type": "Viral",
      "symptoms": "Symptoms vary widely. Young leaves may show bronze spots, dark brown streaks on stems and petioles, and necrotic lesions. Terminal shoots may exhibit purpling and stunting, often leading to dieback. Fruits develop characteristic concentric rings of red, yellow, or green, often giving a 'target spot' appearance, making them unmarketable. Transmitted by thrips, primarily Frankliniella occidentalis and Thrips tabaci.",
      "management_procedures": {
        "organic": [
          "Install blue sticky traps (20-25/acre) to monitor and trap thrips, which are the primary vectors.",
          "Spray Neem oil (5 ml/L water) or bio-pesticides like Verticillium lecanii (5g/L water) or Beauveria bassiana (5g/L water) for thrips control.",
          "Remove and destroy infected plants promptly to reduce inoculum sources.",
          "Use reflective mulches (silver or aluminum foil) in the nursery and field to deter thrips."
        ],
        "chemical": [
          "Control thrips vector: Spray systemic insecticides like Spinosad 45 SC (0.3 ml/L water) or Fipronil 5 SC (1.5 ml/L water) or Imidacloprid 17.8 SL (0.3 ml/L water) at 7-10 day intervals during susceptible stages. Rotate insecticides to prevent resistance."

      "preventive_tips": [
        "Use resistant or tolerant varieties if available.",
        "Manage thrips populations effectively in and around the field.",
        "Remove weed hosts (e.g., Bidens pilosa, Amaranthus spp.) that may harbor thrips and the virus.",
        "Plant healthy, virus-free seedlings.",

    "blossom_end_rot": {
      "name": "Blossom End Rot (BER)",
      "causal_agent": "Physiological disorder caused by localized calcium deficiency in developing fruit, often linked to inconsistent water supply, rapid growth, or impaired calcium transport.",
      "type": "Physiological Disorder",
      "symptoms": "A water-soaked spot appears on the blossom end (bottom) of the fruit, typically when fruits are green. The spot enlarges, turns dark brown or black, becomes leathery and sunken. This primary damage can be followed by secondary fungal or bacterial infections, causing soft rot. Affects the first fruits on a cluster more commonly and can occur on subsequent fruits.",
      "management_procedures": {
        "organic": [
          "Maintain consistent soil moisture through regular, even irrigation (drip irrigation is ideal). Avoid dry spells followed by heavy watering.",
          "Incorporate sufficient organic matter (compost, well-decomposed FYM) into soil to improve water retention and soil structure.",
          "Use Calcium-rich organic amendments like bone meal or gypsum (applied to soil at 100-200 kg/acre) at the pre-planting stage."
        ],
        "chemical": [
          "Foliar spray of Calcium Chloride (2g/L water) or Chelated Calcium (1g/L water) weekly once symptoms appear on early fruits, or as a preventative measure during flowering and early fruit set (3-4 sprays).",
          "Ensure adequate soil calcium by supplementing with Calcium Nitrate (3-5 kg/acre/week) through fertigation during fruit development stage."

      },
      "preventive_tips": [
        "Maintain uniform and adequate soil moisture, avoiding extreme fluctuations (too wet or too dry).",
        "Ensure proper soil calcium levels and balanced nutrition; avoid excessive nitrogen fertilization, which can inhibit calcium uptake.",
        "Maintain soil pH in the optimal range (6.0-7.0) for calcium availability.",
        "Mulch beds (e.g., with straw or plastic mulch) to conserve soil moisture and regulate soil temperature.",
        "Select varieties less prone to BER, as some are genetically more susceptible."
