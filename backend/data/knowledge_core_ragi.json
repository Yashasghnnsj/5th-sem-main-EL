Alternatively, use a seed dresser like *Carbendazim* (2g/kg of seed) or *Thiram* (2.5g/kg of seed) for fungal disease control, followed by *Azospirillum* (25g/kg) if not using a combined biofertilizer.",
        "Sowing Method (Direct): Broadcast the treated seeds uniformly at a seed rate of 7-10 kg/ha for rainfed conditions and 5-7 kg/ha for irrigated conditions. In irrigated areas, sowing in lines at a spacing of 22.5 cm x 10 cm is recommended. Adjust seed rate based on seed size and germination percentage.",

        "Fertilizer Application (Basal): Apply basal dose of NPK at 50:25:25 kg/ha (or 40:20:20 kg/ha for rainfed conditions). Use Urea, Single Super Phosphate (SSP), and Muriate of Potash (MOP) as sources. Incorporate fertilizers into the soil before sowing or at the time of sowing.",
        "Irrigation (Nursery): Maintain adequate moisture in the nursery bed. Light irrigation using a rose can or sprinkler is recommended to avoid disturbing seedlings.",
